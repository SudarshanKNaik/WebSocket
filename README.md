# WebSocket Real-Time Communication Demo

This project demonstrates the use of WebSockets for persistent, bidirectional communication between a client and a server, enabling real-time data exchange. Unlike HTTP, which is unidirectional and requires repeated requests for updates, WebSockets maintain a continuous connection, making them ideal for applications like trading platforms, chat apps, and live dashboards.

## Highlights

- **Real-Time Data Exchange:** Efficiently transmit dynamic updates (e.g., stock prices, indices) between client and server.
- **Bidirectional Communication:** Both client and server can send and receive messages at any time.
- **Efficient Protocol:** Reduces overhead compared to HTTP polling or server-sent events.
- **Single Persistent Connection:** Avoids repeated handshakes and new connections for each update.

## How It Works

1. **Server Setup:**
   - The server uses a WebSocket library to listen for incoming connections.
   - Once a client connects, the server can send and receive messages in real time.

2. **Client Connection:**
   - The client establishes a WebSocket connection to the server.
   - Messages can be sent and received without repeated HTTP requests.

3. **Data Exchange:**
   - Both sides can transmit data (e.g., JSON, buffers) instantly.
   - Ideal for scenarios requiring frequent updates, such as trading apps.

## HTTP vs. WebSocket

| Feature           | HTTP                | WebSocket           |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Connection        | Short-lived         | Persistent          |
| Communication     | Unidirectional      | Bidirectional       |
| Overhead          | High (repeated req) | Low (single conn)   |
| Real-Time Support | Limited             | Excellent           |

## Testing with Hoppscotch

[Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/) is a free, open-source API development tool that supports WebSocket testing.

### Steps:
1. Open [Hoppscotch WebSocket](https://hoppscotch.io/connect/ws).
2. Enter your server's WebSocket URL (e.g., `ws://localhost:3000`).
3. Connect and start sending/receiving messages in real time.

## Running the Project

### Server
1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```powershell
   cd server
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```powershell
   node index.js
   ```

### Client
- Implement a client in your preferred language or use Hoppscotch for quick testing.

## Libraries
- Node.js: [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) (WebSocket server)
- Hoppscotch: For manual WebSocket testing
